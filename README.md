## An image classification API

## To use for your own server, you will need to create the below directories and file in the root folder:

### /app/configs/configfile.json

## For the config file:
### A Google Cloud Platform config file used for the GCP image classification API can be acquired when creating your GCP account here https://cloud.google.com/

## Now also contains source for webapp version of waila as it runs on the same instance. Nothing fancy.

Webapp is running on https://146.185.164.60

To call the API within your own project you can call:
```https://146.185.164.60/api/vision/imageClassify``` as a POST method passing in your image file.
